Aerodynamic Study of Tesla Model 3 for increased efficiency gains from removing mirrors. [Unplugged Performance](https://unpluggedperformance.com/aerodynamic-study-of-tesla-model-3/)

**Result:** From a factory baseline Tesla Model 3, it was determined that removing the mirrors entirely resulted in a 2.8% total decrease in vehicle drag and a reduction of Cd by 0.006.
